  - title: Bitfields
    desc:  >
      Groups of non-exclusive booleans are stored for efficiency as
      integers. Each bit for each field is named in these vectors.

  - title: Lookup functions
    desc:  >
      Some fields are values which we want to 'look up' in
      related tables later.

  - title: Internal functions
    desc:  >
      These are used within the code but are not exported; you only
      need to know how they work if you are modifying SSNAPInterface.

  - title: In progress / unsafe functions
    desc:  >
      Functions in this category are recognised as being important.
      However they haven't been fully tested, or their API or
      precise role within the code hasn't been determined so should
      not be part of the fixed code. They start with the name
      "unsafe" until they are more complete and/or tested.
